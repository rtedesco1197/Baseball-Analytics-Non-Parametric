# BaseballAnalytics-NonParametric

This project uses non-parametric statisitics in R to answer three questions related to MLB analytics:

1. What is the "best" baseball statistic?

2. Using bootstrapping to find a team's expected ranking/placement next season.

3. Using bootstrapping to compare the ability of two players.

Source code is available through the .Rmd report.
